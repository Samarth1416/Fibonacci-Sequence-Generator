# Fibonacci-Sequence-Generator
 This tool is a Fibonacci Sequence Generator that allows users to create a sequence of a custom length starting with defined initial numbers (F  0 ​   and F  1 ​  ). It displays the generated terms, the sequence's sum, and the Golden Ratio (ϕ). It also explains the Fibonacci formula (F n ​  =F n−1 ​  +F n−2 ​  ) and its connection to nature.
