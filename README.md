# ∞ Fibonacci Sequence Generator
 This tool is a Fibonacci Sequence Generator that allows users to create a sequence of a custom length starting with defined initial numbers (F0 ​and F1). It displays the generated terms, the sequence's sum, and the Golden Ratio (ϕ). It also explains the Fibonacci formula    (Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2) and its connection to nature.
